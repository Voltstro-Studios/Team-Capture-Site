# Welcome to the Team-Capture website

Yea, thats right, we got off our asses, did some front end development and designed and built a website for Team-Capture. Is this just gonna turn into what happened with [Voltstro's blog](https://voltstro.dev/blog/) where there is a post once a year? Maybe... possibly.

If you view this site in-game, then you will see some other cool shit we added.

Anyway, enjoy the site, its designed after Team-Capture's game UI theme, so it should look like you are at home, and I gotta say, it turned out better then what I was expecting. Turns out Bootstrap is pretty good...

Also I just realized that I gotta thing for launching sites near or in April.
