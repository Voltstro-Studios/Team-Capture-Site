Is this just gonna turn into what happened with [Voltstro's blog](https://voltstro.dev/blog/) where there is a post once a year? Maybe... possibly.\n\nIf you view this site in-game, then you will see some other cool shit we added.\n\nAnyway, enjoy the site, its designed after Team-Capture's game UI theme, so it should look like you are at home, and I gotta say, it turned out better then what I was expecting. Turns out Bootstrap is pretty good...\n\nAlso I just realized that I gotta thing for launching sites near or in April."}},"path":"news/2021/5/3/teamcapture-website"}
